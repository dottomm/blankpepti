# Focus Area 3: Interagency Collaboration and Statewide Scale-up 



The aim is to foster interagency collaboration through a joint taskforce between the Early Childhood and Special Education partners within the CDE and DDS. The taskforce will develop and disseminate resources that align IDEA Part B and Part C services to better serve CA young children with disabilities and their families in California.
