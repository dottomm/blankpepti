<h2> A Collaboration</h2>



Partnerships for Effective Practices in Transition and Inclusion is a collaboration between the California Department of Education Special Education Division and Early Childhood Division, the Department of Developmental Services in an effort to enhance the outcomes for young children with disabilities or at risk for developmental delays through the improvement of personnel development systems in early intervention, early education, and transition services. The Napa County Office of Education’s (NCOE) Research and Professional Development Center is responsible for facilitating the project. Project funding runs 2023-2028, thanks to a State Personnel Development Grant (SPDG) within the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part D (Title 20, United States Code Section 1451–1455).
