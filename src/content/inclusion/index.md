<h2 class='CenterTitle'> Project Activities</h2> 

### EI Professional learning  
    
Provide professional learning in the Embedded Instruction model to 36 Pre-K classrooms across 6 Local Education Agencies (including County Offices of Education (COEs) and charters) in diverse geographic and demographic regions. Over four years, teachers and coaches from the Local Education Agency will engage in 50 hours of professional development, including practice-based coaching.

### Job Embedded-Coaching
    
Offer job-embedded coaching to support 6 site-based coaches and preschool teachers in participating classrooms. Two statewide coaches will oversee the completion of the Embedded Instruction asynchronous module, host bi-weekly PLCs with participants and monthly coach consultations, and review and respond to monthly coach videos and logs to support the fidelity of implementation. 

### LEA sustainability and scale-up
    
Promote sustainability and scale-up by training and coaching local coaches and teachers, showcasing demonstration classrooms, and engaging administrators in regular continuous improvement cycles to evaluate data, refine implementation, and build capacity for sustainability and scale-up.
