# Focus Area 2: Family-Guided Transitions 

The objective is to build the capacity of early-start professionals responsible for Part C transition to cultivate productive interactions with families, children, and teachers to promote equitable access and support for educational opportunities for children with disabilities.

<h2 class='CenterTitle'> Project Activities</h2>

### Family-guided practices training module 

Develop and disseminate a virtual training module on family-guided practices, integrating it into existing systems such as CEITAN’s Regional Center training and DDS Communities of Practice website, and scaling it up to kindergarten transition teams through the PTIC partnership. The ELAFRC will develop and disseminate a training module for the 47 statewide FRNs (other transition-team professionals, families, and Pre-K staff). Dr. Hall will interview culturally diverse families of children with disabilities to develop a summary report on their challenges, needs, and values in creating successful partnerships with Early Service providers.
    
### Family Partnership Professional Learning Communities

Facilitate a community of practice and book study led by Dr. Holdren on Turnbull’s Sunshine Model using the book Families and Professionals (2021) to provide ongoing job-embedded learning and implementation support for LEA, FRC, FEC, and PTIC staff.

### Transition support materials

Develop transition support materials for broad dissemination, including an informational pamphlet on Part C resources for Part B professionals, and an interactive e-Resource map on Part C resources and referral networks, and a library of video vignettes showcasing successful practitioner-family partnerships.
