		<p>The primary objective of this project is to enhance the outcomes for young children with disabilities or at risk for developmental delays. This will be achieved through the improvement of personnel development systems in early intervention, early education, and transition services.  Project funding runs 2023-2028, thanks to a State Personnel Development Grant (SPDG) within the Office of Special Education Programs (OSEP) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), Part D (Title 20, United States Code Section 1451–1455). </p>
